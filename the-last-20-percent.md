In 1 sentence: There's a lot of really great tools for software developpers but many of them fall short at the last step; pick the tools that won't fail. 

Points
  * There's a lot of churn in software frameworks
  * Some of them stand the test of time. Nothing is eternal but you can stay sane.
  * Convenience vs black boxes
  * The ones that cover the 20% are often a bit more challenging (strong part of the fort)
  * The best tools are ones that provide an abstraction that's been shown to be complete, sometimes mathematically
  * Decent ones are ones who at least don't block lower levels
