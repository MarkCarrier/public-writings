What does your ideal software development team look like?  How big is it?  What kinds of people are on it?  For some of us, the beautiful concept of collaboration has been soured by years of difficult work environments.  Teamwork has become a heavy burden that prevents us from doing what we love: writing actual software.  Senior developers and architects must disconnect and abscond to accomplish meaningful tasks.   In recent years, the majority of positive comments that I've heard regarding software teams were unrelated to productivity:  the workplace is a source of social interactions and friendships.  That's fine but the main reason we organized ourselves in teams should be to accomplish something that we think will be impossible otherwise.  

Outside the world of software, collaboration is often portrayed as the only way to get things done in the 21st century.  According to [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/30/we-hail-individual-geniuses-success-in-science-collaboration-nobel-prize), "Even in the individual labs of most leading scientists, the results are invariably born of a joint effort."  and "Individuals can achieve a lot, but teams can achieve much more."  Shouldn't this be true about software development?  Why doesn't it felt this way?

## Build the right kind of team, learn from the batman
If developing software as a team is not something that awakens warm fuzzy feelings inside of you or your employees, then I'm going to venture to claim that you've been looking at collaboration in software the wrong way.  Alternatively, if you're new to software development, here's your chance to learn how to not get bogged down by ineffective collaboration that permeate so many workplaces today.  You can easily lose _years_ of knowledge growth if you're not collaborating the right way.  So what's the right way?  To answer this question, we will take lessons from an extremely productive individual: the Batman.

Doesn't the batman work alone?  He certainly claims to have a clear policy regarding teamwork.

Despite what the Dark Knight might pretend, he, more than any other superhero, is dependent of others.  He has no superpowers at all!  The Batman can only protect Gotham thanks to the support of other people.  First of all, there's of course Alfred Pennyworth, who acts as a moral anchor and source of wisdom and new perspectives.  There's also Commissioner Gordon who keeps our hero aware of the city's problems and needs.  Collaboration between him and the Batman is continuous.  And we certainly can't forget Lucius Fox, Bruce's business manager and critical provider of the technological toys and gadgets that allow the Batman to get things done.

Just like the Batman, you don't need superhuman abilities to become a "rock star" developer.  Just like the Batman, getting anything done completely on your own is also impossible.  Do you have the time and ability to write your own HTTP server?  How about a date-time library?  You might not realize [how complex this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY).  Don't forget the leap seconds.  Would you build your own compiler?  Image, video, file compression algorithms?  How about an operating system?  Will you build a preemptive process scheduler or a cooperative one?  How about a microprocessor?  Will you go for a reduced or a complex instruction set architecture? The truth is that the first line of your own code that you ever executed was possible thanks to thousands of people who've worked millions of hours designing and building these things.  Perhaps more than in any other profession, we programmers "stand on the shoulder of giants".

Like Bruce, we inherited a _massive_ fortune from our engineering parents which gives incredible creative freedom.  This is what drew me to programming as a teenager.  Even in the absence of a personal teacher, I was able to start creating programs on my dad's 286 IBM Compatible.  And that was without an internet connection! Today, even with the most budget friendly computer and connection, you can start collaborating with thousands of people who have collectively built, and continue to build,  myriads of amazing hardware and software systems.  In 2018, about 50% of the planet's inhabitants have access to this.

The reasons why this is possible are worth considering:
1. Building silicon based hardware is _cheap_.
2. Copying and distributing digital information is _extremely easy_.
3. The mathematical principles at the root computer science make it possible to split big software problems into many smaller problems.

Every time your computer gets an update, you're reaping the benefits of the above.  

So is being Batman easy?  No, you need to learn to handle these cool tools.  The hardest part of software development is learning.  I'm going to say that again.  The hardest part of software development is learning.  Here it is a third time, using different words:

4. Copying and distributing human knowledge is _extremely difficult_.

This is why we often have no other choice but to rely on systems that we don't fully understand. 

These four facts needs to be at the bottom of our collaboration and team building strategy.
